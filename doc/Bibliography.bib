abstract = {The Healthy, Mobility and Security-based Data Communication Architecture, also known as HAMSTER, is provided with a special platform for safety {\&} security: Sphere. It concentrates all the safety {\&} security aspects of the main architecture and all derivative versions. The aim is to define patterns for assuring safety {\&} security that allow every unmanned vehicle derived from HAMSTER to safely share information, even when different scenarios are involved, e. g. to permit the safe communication between an unmanned ground vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle. It is also a goal of Sphere to centralize the modules �health� check, which guarantees a safer operation for the vehicle and, consequently, the entire system. Modules and subsystems criticality measurements are proposed as part of the architecture definition for research {\&}development of robust, safe, health and secure unmanned vehicles and systems.},
